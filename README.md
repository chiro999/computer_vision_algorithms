Exploring computer vision algorithms with OpenCV including Optical Flow, Viola-Jones algorithm and Pose Estimation.

#Optical Flow
Optical flow is a technique used to describe image motion. It is usually applied to a series of images that have a small time step between them, for example, video frames. Optical flow calculates a velocity for points within the images, and provides an estimation of where points could be in the next image sequence. A popular application of Optical Flow is in Nvidia's 
Deep Learning Super Resolution 3 (DLSS3). DLSS 3 uses optical flow to produce motion interpolation providing an increase in frame rate. This is accelerated by a hardware ASIC called the Optical Flow Accelerator exclusive to the 40 series.
